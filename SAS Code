*Examining multicollinearity between the different variables;
*nAtBat has a strong, significant positive association with nHit and nRun and a 
moderate, significant positive association with nHome.
CrAtBat has a strong, significant positive association with CrHit, CrHome, and CrRun.
This is possibly because players with better batting statistics are at bat more often.
CrAtBat has a strong, positive association with YrMajor.
nAtBat and YrMajor will be in the model, while CrAtBat, CrHit, CrHome, CrRun, nHit, nRun, and nHome will not.;

*Examining multicollinearity between more variables;
*CrBB and CrRBi have strong, significant positive associations with YrMajor and will not be in the model.
nErrors is very much not associated with logsalary and will not be in the model.
nAtBat has a strong, significant association with nRBI, a moderate, significant association with nBB 
and a weak, significant association with nAssts and nOut. The strong and moderate associations
likely have the same causes as previously listed, and the variables will not be in the model.
The weak associations are both actions done by fielders, and thus the association is likely due to 
the overall number of games played.;
